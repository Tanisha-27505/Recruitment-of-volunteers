# Recruitment-of-volunteers
As there is an increase in percentage of Corona cases,there's a rise in increasing the availability of helpers and volunteers. 
For prescribed medicine and day to day assistance helpers can be assigned in a faster way. 
Another challenge is to collect all the information of the volunteers and store all the data, and also provide them their work as per their qualification. 
This system will maintain all the records of volunteers/helpers and the work assigned for each and every person. 
Its an AEIOU framework report on recruitment of volunteers with an attached proto.io model.
